### About:
The goal of the game is to escape Markville! There are three levels (the floors of the school, from top to bottom) where you will encounter many enemies (🐮🐄) that you have to beat. You will be able to pick up weapons and items to help you defeat the enemies and reach the end. In each room, you will be able to speak to NPCs (teachers) for hints as to where to find keys to help you unlock rooms. Find your way out of the school!

### Cheats for Ms. Wong:
